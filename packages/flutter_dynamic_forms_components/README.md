[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/flutter_dynamic_forms_components.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_dynamic_forms_components)

A flutter project containing default set of components for the flutter dynamic forms library.

Most of the components are generated using [dynamic_forms_generator](https://github.com/markphillips100/flutter_dynamic_forms/tree/master/packages/dynamic_forms_generator).

**Note** There is an issue where example project may not work in the IDE after running `flutter packages pub run build_runner build`. You can work around it by deleting `.dart_tool` folder.
